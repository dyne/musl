# ðŸ’ª GNU / musl compilers by Dyne.org

## Introduction

This is a **fully static**, pre-built cross-compilation toolchain for x86_64 Linux hosts (any, including WSL2 and Alpine) that combines the GNU compiler collection (GCC with Binutils, GMP, MPC and MPFR) with the musl C library (pronounced "muscle").

Our C/C++ toolchain is optimized to be small in size, produce static binaries, and **support the latest C++20 standard** and be updated for future versions.

We enable bare-metal as well virtualized **builds of static binaries that run everywhere**, without installing additional system packages, chroots, docker images, qemu or dealing with distribution-specific patches.

## Usage

The hard-coded absolute path this toolchain resides is: `/opt/dyne/gcc-musl`

One should therefore include `/opt/dyne/gcc-musl/bin` in $PATH:
```sh
export PATH=/opt/dyne/gcc-musl/bin:$PATH
```

Look inside the bin directory for the list of executable compiler
tools and setup `CC`, `CXX`, `LD` and `AR` flags accordingly for each build system used by your projects.

We also ship base libraries commonly used in C/C++ applications: **libreSSL, ZLib-ng, libSSH2 and libCURL**, as well ccache to speed compilation. There are found in `/opt/dyne/$ARCH` where `$ARCH` is the targetes architecture that must be installed. Multiple target architectures can be installed and coexist in `/opt/dyne`.

### Easy use in CMake

If you are using `cmake` for your builds then use our toolchain file:
```sh
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="/opt/dyne/gcc-musl/settings.cmake"
```
Make sure to config `-DARCH=""` to your target architecture, here a list of all configurable options and their defaults:
```cmake
# Configurable settings
set(ARCH "x86_64-linux-musl" CACHE STRING "Target architecture to (cross)compile")
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-static --static -g0 -Os -fstack-protector-all -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fno-strict-overflow" CACHE STRING "C++ Compilation flags, default set for small and secure binaries")
set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "-static --static -g0 -Os -fstack-protector-all -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fno-strict-overflow" CACHE STRING "C Compilation flags, default set for small and secure binaries")
set(ROOT "/opt" CACHE STRING "Base root prefix for installation (often referred as PREFIX or DESTDIR)")
option(CCACHE "Use ccache to speed up compilation" 1)
option(FOR_MUSL_DYNE "Install target will copy everything inside /opt/musl-dyne" 0)
option(FORCE_STATIC "Force linker flags to build static executables (may fix or break some cases)" 0)
```

## Source components

All sources are mirrored on [files.dyne.org](https://files.dyne.org/musl?dir=musl/sources)

The latest build includes the following source components: `binutils-2.44.tar.gz`, `gcc-15.1.0.tar.xz`, `gmp-6.1.2.tar.bz2`, `linux-5.8.5.tar.xz`, `mpc-1.1.0.tar.gz`, `mpfr-4.0.2.tar.bz2`, and `musl-1.2.5.tar.gz`.

Additional base libraries and utilities provided are `libressl-4.1.0`, `zlib-ng-2.2.4`, `curl-8.15.0`, `libssh2-1.11.1`, and `ccache-4.11.3`.

Build flags used: `--disable-nls --disable-libmudflap --disable-libsanitizer --disable-lto`. Features enabled: decimal-float, fixed-point, quadmath, as well libitm to satisfy advanced C++ requirements. Debugging functions are omitted.


Builds are fully automated over CI and use semantic versioning that is
specific to dyne/musl and unrelated to gcc or musl release versions.

## Supported target architectures

We provide cross-compilers running on x86_64 and capable to target the
following architectures:

| name in docs  | file suffix | unix architecture name |
|---------------|-------------|------------------------|
| X86â€¯64â€‘bit    | x86_64      | `x86_64-linux-musl`    |
| ARMâ€¯64â€‘bit    | arm_64      | `aarch64-linux-musl`   |
| ARM HF 32-bit | arm_hf      | `arm-linux-musleabihf` |
| RISC-V 64-bit | riscv_64    | `riscv64-linux-musl`   |

More target may be available in the future, [get in touch with us](mailto:info@dyne.org) if you need:

Supported architectures include: `aarch64[_be]-linux-musl`, `i*86-linux-musl`, `microblaze[el]-linux-musl`, `mips-linux-musl`, `mips[el]-linux-musl[sf]`, `mips64[el]-linux-musl[n32][sf]`, `powerpc-linux-musl[sf]`, `powerpc64[le]-linux-musl`, `s390x-linux-musl`, `sh*[eb]-linux-musl[fdpic][sf]`, and `x86_64-linux-musl[x32]`.

## Patches included

In addition to canonical musl support patches for GCC,
musl-cross-make's patch set provides:

- Static-linked PIE support
- Addition of `--enable-default-pie`
- Fixes for SH-specific bugs and bitrot in GCC
- Support for J2 Core CPU target in GCC & binutils
- SH/FDPIC ABI support
